# üìö Distraction Analysis in Online Learning Environments

A real-time system to detect and analyze student distraction during online classes using computer vision and behavioral analytics.

## üìù Description
The rise of online education faces a significant challenge in maintaining student engagement and focus due to numerous distractions and the absence of real-time monitoring. The **Distraction Analysis** project offers a robust framework to address this issue by measuring and enhancing learner focus in virtual environments.

The system leverages a combination of behavioral data, machine learning, and real-time feedback to create a standardized metric for evaluating distraction levels during online sessions. It analyzes a learner's head pose, gaze direction, drowsiness, and facial expressions to provide a dynamic score that reflects their level of engagement. This approach provides educators with actionable insights to refine course delivery and helps learners develop self-awareness for improved academic outcomes.
